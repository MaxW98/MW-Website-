                <h1>Autopilot (Tesla)</h1>
            
                <p> Tesla Autopilot is a driver assist feature of their autonomous vehicles, by the end of 2017 these vehicles are set to be fully autonomous; acknowledging that legal, regulatory and technical hurdles must be overcome to achieve this goal.<br><br>
                Tesla requires operators to monitor the vehicle at all times, just as the Federal Aviation Administration requires pilots to monitor aircraft on autopilot. Autopilot includes multiple capabilities, including adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning. Tesla expects to enable full self-driving by the end of 2017.<br><br>
            
                The problem with this technology is the threat from hackers, considering the car can be updated over a wireless connection and is controlled via a computer raises a lot of concern. This vulnerability doesn't only effect the cars Autopilot function but also features within the car such as seats, indicators and the sunroof. Making sure security measures are put in place and constant updates provide patches for any weaknesses is essential for the vehicles safety and the cloud conntection between it.

                <h1>Virtual Reality (VR)</h1>
            
                <p>Virtual Reality is the computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional image or environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way by a person using special electronic equipment, such as a helmet with a screen inside or gloves fitted with sensors.<br><br>
            
                Focusing on Virtual Reality headsets the security threat comes with the hacking of software on the devices or the phones which are used within the headset. The massive increase with VR headset technologies and the rapid growth of the features they include this can cause weaknesses in the security of their software. Relating this to cloud security wireless updates could be tampered with or intercepted causing the headsets to become hacked or filled with malware.<br>
                    
                Ensuring that the security of virtual reality stay at a high level with constant updates will reduce the risk of hackers and the cloud aspect to become unsecure.
